*"While traditional DSA may build the internal engine of a coder, focusing solely on it is like tuning a race car engine but never driving it on different tracks. Exploring programs and open source is the act of getting the car out, racing in public, networking with top mechanics, and learning how the entire racing ecosystem operates."*
